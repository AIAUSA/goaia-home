<p>Since 1966, Athletes in Action has been using sports as a platform to help people answer questions of faith and to point them to Jesus. We believe that sports has the power to open doors and create connections in a way that few other things can, and that’s why we are constantly working to create new ways of reaching out to athletes and sports fans alike. Ultimately, our goal is to see peoples’ lives changed as they discover God’s purpose for their life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We dream of a day when there are Christ-followers on every team, in sport, in every nation. We believe this is possible when organizations and individuals -- who want every athlete to know someone who truly follows Jesus -- work together toward the common goal of furthering God’s kingdom.</p>
<p>Sports is a universal language. Everyone, regardless of race, culture, socio-economic status or religious conviction, understands the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">As we work toward the fulfillment of our goal of seeing Christ-followers on every team, in every sport,<span class="s1">&nbsp;</span>in every nation<span class="s2">,</span>&nbsp;we’re dependent on God to raise up national leaders around the world who will use the platform of sports to bring the gospel to their country. We really believe that entire cultures and nations can be changed for the better as athletic leaders use their unique positions to point others to Christ.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Partnerships with like-minded ministries and individuals are a vital element of our dream of reaching “every.”<span class="s1">&nbsp;</span>Whether it’s at global events like the Olympics or World Cup or in a community competition between local teams, opportunities to work together to impact and equip others are abundant.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Athletes in Action is present in more than 90 countries and is a part of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cru.org/">Cru</a>&nbsp;(formerly called Campus Crusade for Christ). Cru is the name of CCC in the United States.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we dream of a day when there are Christ-followers on every team, every sport, every nation, we’re pursuing growth in three key areas that we believe are vital to the success of our overall mission.</p>
<p><span><strong>Oneness:</strong>&nbsp;The intentional effort toward Biblical unity reflecting the diverse world of sport</span></p>
<p><em>Goal:&nbsp;Trusting God to have all aspects of AIA (discipleship groups, leadership teams, partner ministries, volunteers, staff team, advisory boards, etc.) proportionately represent the athletic communities we serve.</em></p>
<p><span><strong>Equipping Leaders for Multiplication:&nbsp;</strong></span>Exponentially giving away training for spiritual multiplication.</p>
<p><em>Goal: Trusting God&nbsp;for 3,692&nbsp;equipped disciples in Win, Build, and Send ministry.</em></p>
<p><span><strong>Sending:&nbsp;</strong></span>In pursuit of every disciple sent, we are trusting God to staff the vision.</p>
<p><em>Goal: Trusting God for 205 new staff members.</em></p>
