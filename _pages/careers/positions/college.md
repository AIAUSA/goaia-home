There&rsquo;s pressure to perform in order to earn playing time or a spot on the team<span class="s1"> </span>or to simply keep a scholarship. Between classes, practice and traveling to compete, it&rsquo;s hard to find time to get to church or a Bible study. Sometimes their unique status as an NCAA athlete can even make it hard to know who can be trusted.&nbsp;</p><p class="p3"></p><p class="p3"></p><p class="p2">But in the face of these challenges, God is drawing many athletes to Himself. As more athletes discover the freedom of playing for God, lives are changed.</p><p class="p3"></p><p class="p3"></p><p class="p2">That&rsquo;s why we need you. You can be a part of the bigger story God is writing by being the person who engages with these athletes emotionally, intellectually and spiritually within their campus environment.
