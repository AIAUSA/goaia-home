Medical coverage is optional for interns if you have proof of other medical coverage. Part-time staff members aren&rsquo;t eligible for benefits.</p><h2>Debt&nbsp;</h2><p>Cru/AIA&rsquo;s intention is to position our new staff members for success in ministry partner development (MPD), ministry and life. Experience has shown us that missionary staff members who have unmanageable debt are hindered in their ability to serve in ministry. We are also concerned with the appropriateness of ministry partners helping to pay off an applicant&rsquo;s past consumer debt. Since we do not expect everyone to be debt-free, minimal debt is acceptable. As part of the staff member application process, you will be asked to complete a financial addendum that lists your current debts. A formula is then used to compare this amount to your potential salary. If your debt versus salary percentage is too high, we may ask you to lower your debt and then reapply to join our staff. If you have non-mortgage debt over $25,000 contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:pat.lower@athletesinaction.org">Pat Lower</a> to run a debt calculation prior to the application.<br /><br /></p><p>For more general information about our employment categories please contact <a href="mailto:pat.lower@athletesinaction.org">Pat Lower</a>.</p>
