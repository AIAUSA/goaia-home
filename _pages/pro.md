<div class="container mt20"><p>&nbsp; <img class="img-responsive pull-left" src="/uploads/pro/pro-main1.jpg"> Athletes in Action regularly partners with like-minded ministries to create outreaches for professional sports teams and athletes.&nbsp;Our intent is to build into the lives of coaches, players and their spouses, while helping them positively impact their communities. We want to help professional athletes and their fans answer questions of faith.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Whether they’re competing for a spot in the starting line-up, dealing with an unexpected trade and move, or balancing a busy practice and travel schedule, professional athletes and their families face tremendous pressure and stress. Our goal is to help balance these demands by giving athletes a new framework for competition: honoring God by competing to the best of their ability and leaving the outcome in His hands. &nbsp;</p>

<h3><a href="/pro/nfl">NFL</a></h3>
<p>“NFL Football – it’s like watching modern- day gladiators in action. Every Sunday, some of the greatest athletes that have ever played the game strap on their battle gear and engage in fierce competition. They are trained to be intense, focused, disciplined, tough, and relentless. No wonder people all over the world view them as heroes.”</p>

<h3><a href="/pro/wnba">WNBA</a></h3>
<p>"I am so grateful to our WNBA chaplains for their support, encouragement and mentorship. As life in professional sports can become chaotic, our chapel services before every game give me the ability to stay grounded and encouraged in my faith. Since my rookie year, my chaplain has been the most influential person in my spiritual development, and I cherish her role in my life!"</p>

<h3><a href="/pro/cycling">Cycling</a></h3>
<p>"Cycling at the top level is very isolated and demanding. It is a challenging environment to be racing around the world immersed in a secular and self-serving culture ten months of the year. AIA has begun connecting me with other Christians in the sport offering Biblical encouragement and accountability.”</p>

<p>“Our group of national team brothers comes together to pray, to speak about the Bible and Jesus Christ, and to help each other through His plan for all of us. It is unique and it is different, and most of all, it is awesome. We are able to come together from all over the world at different parts of our careers and different ages, for one common goal of…representing Jesus Christ on the national team.”</p>

<h3 class="p2">COSTA RICA</h3>
<p class="p2"><br>&nbsp; <img class="img-responsive pull-left" src="/uploads/pro/pro-service-1.jpg"> For a number of years, AIA has sent a group of NFL players to Costa Rica to conduct sports clinics and share the love of Jesus through service projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p3"></p>
<p class="p2"><i><br>“The trip impacted my life in many ways. Seeing families in hard situations who still had smiles on their faces and appreciated the small things in life gave me the conviction that I can’t complain about anything in my life. They blessed me more than I blessed them by far.”</i>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2"><b>– Demar Dotson, offensive lineman, Tampa Bay Buccaneers</b></p>
<p class="p3"></p>
<p class="p2"><i>“One of the things we try to do is be a catalyst to ministry that’s already happening there, so that when we leave they’re further down the road in their work. It’s all to help build relationships and develop credibility for the local ministry.”&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="p2"><b>– Doug Gilcrease, AIA staff member and chaplain to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers</b></p>

<h3 class="p2"><br><br>MEXICO</h3>
<p class="p4"></p>
<p class="p4"><img class="img-responsive pull-right" src="/uploads/pro/pro-service-2.jpg">Through partnerships with More Than Sport and Companies With a Mission, a group of professional cyclists took a two-day trip to Mexico to help build homes for five families in need.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p2"><i>“It was certainly an unforgettable experience. It was so great to know that I’m directly helping a family in need, and to work with my hands to achieve it. To finally put skin in the game of helping others is very powerful, and I have thought about it every day since. It’s impossible for such a trip to not give you some perspective.”</i></p>
<p class="p2"><b>–</b><strong>&nbsp;Chad Haga, pro cyclist for Team Giant-Shimano</strong></p>
<p class="p3"></p>
<p class="p2"><i>“The athletes in this sport are so disciplined that giving up three days of training on their bikes is unheard of, especially if they are giving back to someone else.”&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="p2"><b>– Todd Henriksen, director of AIA Cycling</b></p>

<h3 class="p2"><br>SOUTH AFRICA</h3>
<p class="p2"><br><img class="img-responsive pull-left" src="/uploads/pro/pro-service-3.jpg">In December 2012, a team of pro soccer players traveled to South Africa, where the group engaged in a variety of service projects, outreaches and soccer clinics at churches and orphanages. The trip served to accelerate ministry that was already happening at local churches and through AIA.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p4"></p>
<p class="p2"><i><br>“Even though so many have so little, I saw that God still showers His love on those who follow Him. It is very encouraging to see this, reinforcing my belief that joy and peace are not circumstantial.”&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="p2"><b>– Sean Kelley, goalkeeper, Orlando Soccer Club</b></p>
<p class="p3"></p>
<p class="p2"><i>“The trip was such a success that we already know we want to do this next year. Players are telling us that all of their friends want to come. We believe that this tour and the fruit produced from it will catch like wildfire around the league.”&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="p2"><b>– Zach Blaine, AIA staff member and tour coordinator</b></p>

<p class="p4"><i><br>“I got more out of Africa than Africa got out of me.”&nbsp;</i></p>
