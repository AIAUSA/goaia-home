<p><strong>A spring break or summer trip like no other - a chance to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Experience an ancient culture and God's heart for the nations</li>
<li>Grow in your faith in an authentic Christian community and make lifelong memories</li>
<li>Develop ministry skills that will equip you to impact your campus and lead others spiritually</li>
<li>Share the message of Christ with athletes in an unreached area of the world</li>

<ul>
<li>Two-thirds of the world's population lives in Asia, including 40 of the world's largest cities that have not been reached with the gospel. There are 26 unreached people groups alone living in and around the city where we'll be going, meaning nearly all have never heard the gospel.</li>
<li>Invest your spring break or summer in something that will last forever as you allow God to use you to impact the world.</li>

The cost is *about* $2,000. Is this the first time you have raised funds for a missions project? Do not worry! We will help you raise the funds needed for the project by sending you an information packet once you have been accepted, along with providing a support-raising coach to help you along the way.</p>
