<div class="panel-body">We understand the rigors of competing at a high level, and the necessary discipline needed. We will provide the best nutrition possible, and the best locations to continue your training. Some teams traveling to undeveloped countries have less available than we are accustomed to here in the USA. In certain locations, you will need to be creative and flexible as you seek to keep consistent with your training schedule. Team directors are flexible with the team’s schedule, and will allow time for long runs when possible. Good communication with your team director concerning your training needs will help ensure the best possible situation for you.</div>

<div class="panel-body">Each team has an experienced AIA director and discipler. The competitive tours have a certified athletic trainer. The tour director is trained in crisis management, understands injury/illness and emergency protocols, and is certified in CPR/First Aid. We prepare for worst case scenarios, but rarely need to exercise these plans. Most international tours are hosted by local national staff. These native AIA staff are very familiar with the areas in which we will be traveling, and often have lived there for most of their life. They will be present with or at least available for the team 24 hours a day. If there are areas to avoid, they will not allow the team to go there. If there are any emergencies at home or abroad, AIA staff have plans in place for timely communication and evacuation. Each team has secondary insurance and evacuation coverage included in the tour cost.</div>

<div class="panel-body">AIA is a non-profit organization and does not have any central funds. All costs are covered by free-will donations. Each participant will have the opportunity to be trained and receive weekly coaching in order to raise the full amount of funds to cover their portion of the team’s expenses. We use a letter strategy to help each athlete ask businesses, organizations, churches, and individuals for their financial partnership to make it possible for their team to travel.</div>

<div class="panel-body">Each athlete raises funds for their AIA team, not themselves. All donation checks are payable to Athletes in Action. All donations go directly into the AIA team’s account. The athlete does not get their own account. No cash is allowed to be received. No reimbursements or refunds are allowed to the athlete since the athlete is raising money for their AIA team, not themselves. IRS policies prohibit refunds on all donations. Competing and training with an AIA team will not affect your NCAA eligibility. There is no NCAA rules against training or competing with athletes from different teams internationally.</div>

<div class="panel-body">After your application is accepted, an AIA staff will contact you to discuss your placement. We will do our best to honor where you feel the Lord is asking you to serve. There are instances in which a certain tour might be better for some athletes, based upon their skills (both athletically and non-athletically) and the ministry that is already happening in that country. Some of our international staff have a greater connection with one discipline over another (ie distance), so it would make sense for us to send a team of distance runners to help accelerate their ministry.</div>

<div class="panel-body">Each tour plans a full day for cultural debrief and preparing for returning back to the States.

If you don’t feel strong in your faith right now, joining an AIA team is a great place to grow and learn. Also, trust that God will work through you where you are at right now.</div>
