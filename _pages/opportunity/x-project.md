<p>Each intern is expected to raise $2700 support to help with the total cost of X Project. Housing and most meals are provided.</p>
<p>Just like other AIA mission projects, we will equip you to invite others to invest in you as you embrace this opportunity to grow professionally, spiritually and personally. Upon being selected for the project, we will provide a support-raising coach.</p>
<p>Pairs of interns stay with host families who will provide a comfortable place to sleep, good food, and a “home away from home” for the summer.</p>

<h3> What would I do?</h3>
<p>In addition to 30-35 hours on the job per week (280 total hours minimum), you come together with interns from other departments for personal and professional development, training in evangelism and leadership, bible study and discipleship. Additionally, most interns will have the opportunity to provide leadership for an athletic youth camp.</p>

<p>Non-office hours include opportunities to experience authentic community including project dinners, social and evangelistic outings and other intentional, dynamic fellowship.</p>

<p>Part way through the summer, interns will take responsibility for all aspects of X Project beyond the professional development.</p>

<p>"<span>I can't begin to imagine what my life would look like unless [X Project interns and staff] entered it this summer. I will be forever grateful for this experience and the people I have met because of it. I have truly been changed for the better because I met you all.</span>” <strong>–&nbsp;<span>Brittni H. </span></strong></p>
<p>“<span>During X Project, I felt fully immersed in an environment that really developed me spiritually and professionally. Staff was so great at empowering me to be a relational, Godly leader. I never felt looked down on or shamed for my past or my struggles. I spent the summer learning to be and love my authentic self. XP was the perfect way to grow closer to Jesus through experiences and other believers.</span>”<strong> –&nbsp;<span>Annie H. </span></strong></p>
<p>“<span>God showed me that I need Him in every area of my life. I don't just encounter God in my quiet time. I can and need to have Him involved in my plans for my future and for my work in the present.</span>” –&nbsp;<strong>Andy S. </strong></p>
<p>“<span>X Project was the perfect opportunity for me to grow professionally and, more importantly, spiritually. The constant surrounding of community allows for quality relationships to develop and sharpen each other. I also thoroughly enjoyed going through the challenging Principles of AIA, especially 'Victory Beyond Competition.' X Project was a summer full of challenges, fun times, and amazing community, and I would suggest this opportunity to anyone who is looking to grow in their walk with the Lord while gaining valuable internship experience.</span>” – <strong>Kyle H. </strong></p>
