<p>"<span>I can't begin to imagine what my life would look like unless [X Project interns and staff] entered it this summer. I will be forever grateful for this experience and the people I have met because of it. I have truly been changed for the better because I met you all.</span>” <strong>–&nbsp;<span>Brittni H. </span></strong></p>
<p>“<span>During X Project, I felt fully immersed in an environment that really developed me spiritually and professionally. Staff was so great at empowering me to be a relational, Godly leader. I never felt looked down on or shamed for my past or my struggles. I spent the summer learning to be and love my authentic self. XP was the perfect way to grow closer to Jesus through experiences and other believers.</span>”<strong> –&nbsp;<span>Annie H. </span></strong></p>
<p>“<span>God showed me that I need Him in every area of my life. I don't just encounter God in my quiet time. I can and need to have Him involved in my plans for my future and for my work in the present.</span>” –&nbsp;<strong>Andy S. </strong></p>
<p>“<span>X Project was the perfect opportunity for me to grow professionally and, more importantly, spiritually. The constant surrounding of community allows for quality relationships to develop and sharpen each other. I also thoroughly enjoyed going through the challenging Principles of AIA, especially 'Victory Beyond Competition.' X Project was a summer full of challenges, fun times, and amazing community, and I would suggest this opportunity to anyone who is looking to grow in their walk with the Lord while gaining valuable internship experience.</span>” – <strong>Kyle H. </strong></p>
