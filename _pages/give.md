<p>Last year&nbsp;alone, partners like you helped expose 325 million people to the gospel!</p>
<p>Because Athletes in Action is a donor-supported ministry, everything that we do to encourage and equip athletes is a result of financial gifts from friends and partners like you.</p>
<p><i>“God has shown us the need to become lifelong supporters of AIA to continue the ministry of reaching the lost for Jesus Christ through sports.&nbsp;</i><i>It’s one of the best investments for the kingdom of heaven</i><span class="s1"><i>&nbsp;</i></span><i>we will ever make.”&nbsp;</i><strong><i>– </i>ministry partners from Arizona</strong></p>
