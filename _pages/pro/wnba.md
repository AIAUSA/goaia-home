<p class="p1">Through pre-game chapels, weekly Bible studies, off-season mentoring and player retreats and gatherings, our goal is to encourage WNBA athletes in their faith and see them influence their fans and teammates with the hope of the gospel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I am so grateful to our WNBA chaplains for their support, encouragement and mentorship. As life in professional sports can become chaotic, our chapel services before every game give me the ability to stay grounded and encouraged in my faith. Since my rookie year, my chaplain has been the most influential person in my spiritual development, and I cherish her role in my life!"</p>

<p>“As a participant and leader in the Player Getaways and the All-Star Gatherings, I can tell you that the face-to-face time for the players to spend with God and each other are blessed and nurturing. Many relationships established at these events have continued with positive results for the players, coaches and the community.”</p>
