<p class="p1">&nbsp; <img class="img-responsive pull-right" src="/uploads/pro/MLS-page-web.jpg"> In partnership with the MLS, Athletes in Action chaplains provide services for athletes with busy travel and game schedules that often prevent them from being regularly involved in a local church. Through pre-game chapels, group prayer and regular Bible studies, chaplains are present to serve and encourage players as they answer questions of faith.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">AIA’s relationship with the MLS dates back to the beginning of the league, when founding owners requested that AIA provide pre-game chapels for each club. Currently, AIA staff members and volunteers serve athletes and teams throughout the MLS and NASL. In recent years, we’ve provided chaplains and pre-game chapels at the World Cup for the men’s U.S. national team and partnered with other international ministries to place chaplains with teams from Africa and South America at international competitions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"As a professional athlete, it’s very difficult to attend church and take part in fellowship that normal people enjoy given our travel schedules and commitments. Athletes In Action provides mentorship and Bible study that fits our availability in the unique arena of professional sports. As a rookie in 2004, I came to Dallas alone and feeling very far from home. I immediately got involved in AIA by taking part in Bible study and attending chapel. This ministry is worthy to participate in as I learn how to use my platform for His glory and grow in my walk."</p>

<p>“Our group of national team brothers comes together to pray, to speak about the Bible and Jesus Christ, and to help each other through His plan for all of us. It is unique and it is different, and most of all, it is awesome. We are able to come together from all over the world at different parts of our careers and different ages, for one common goal of…representing Jesus Christ on the national team.”</p>
