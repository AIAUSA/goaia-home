<div class="container mt20"><p class="p1">&nbsp; <img class="img-responsive pull-right col-md-5" src="/uploads/Pro/Cycling/cycling1.jpg"> Sport is facing a crossroads with headlines not about highlights and accomplishments, but rather scandal and corruption on a regular basis and cycling is no different. There needs to be a cultural shift, a new generation of athletes who are committed to living with integrity.</p>
<p class="p1">AIA Cycling is passionate about the sport of cycling and we care deeply about the athletes who compete in it. We are dedicated to serve, support, and mentor these athletes to encourage and equip them in the search for significance and purpose in sport and in life.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">With a season that for some starts in January and finishes in October, cyclists can feel isolated and long for community and connection that is hard to find. That’s why we’re passionate about connecting with cyclists in their communities and exposing them to a new way of pursuing sport and living life. Whether you’re looking to grow spiritually or just get connected with other cyclists, we’d be honored to serve you at an upcoming race and support you throughout the year.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">We dream of seeing the sport of cycling transformed and are honored to be a part of the next generation. We are already seeing this next generation of cyclists raised up who are impacting sport, society, and culture through their positive examples.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">We serve, support and mentor elite junior/U23, collegiate, and professional cyclists virtually, locally, and globally by…</p>
<p class="p1">- organizing chapel services at premier races</p>
<p class="p1">- hosting training camps&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">- providing mentorship through individual appointments and small groups&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">- offering an off-season service project in Tijuana, Mexico</p>
<p class="p1">- Resourcing cycling teams by providing leadership and character development</p>

<h3><span>WHAT IS CHARACTER?<br></span></h3>
<p><em><strong><br>"Do my athletes have it?"</strong></em> a coach asks.</p>
<p><em><strong>"Do my teammates have it?"</strong> </em>asks a rider.</p>
<p><em><strong>"How can I grow in character?"</strong></em> "Do I have character?"</p>
<p>Character is an interesting topic because it means different things to different people. Total Athlete has created 12 character study topics for coaches and athletic influencers to use in their sport setting.</p>
<p>Each session includes an explanation on why we are talking about this topic, an outline for your presentation, an example of the presentation, and an application sections. This is a great way to start talking about character within your team.</p>
<p>Because character doesn't change overnight we also have content coming to the Academy for each topic along with mentors to help your athletes stay accountable and grow.<br><br></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.totalathlete.com/character">Sign up to receive the first session</a>&nbsp;<br><br></strong></p>
<h4>WHAT DOES THE BIBLE SAYS ABOUT CHARACTER?</h4>
<h4>HOW DOES IT RELATE TO CYCLING?&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Learn, grow, and apply these character principles to your life in and out of the sport. Feel free to share them with your friends, teammates, and cycling club!</p>
