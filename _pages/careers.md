<h1 class="p1">Careers</h1><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12"><p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"><img src="/uploads/careers/Immersion-web.jpg" alt="" align="left" class="img-responsive pull-right col-md-5" style="height: auto;" />At Athletes in Action, our goal is to change the world by working toward our vision to see Christ-followers on every team, in every sport, in every nation. We believe that the platform of sports has the ability to reach&nbsp;<i>every person</i>&nbsp;with the hope of Jesus. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re always looking for individuals who share our desire to see the world changed by the love of Jesus.&nbsp;<b>Whether you&rsquo;re a high-level athlete looking for a chance to influence the next generation, or a non-athlete who just wants to use your degree to make a difference, we think AIA might be the place for you.</b>&nbsp;The information we&rsquo;ve compiled here is the result of many years of helping people like you consider a career with AIA. To get started, see&nbsp;<a href="/careers/message-from-the-president" style="color: #990000; text-decoration: none;">A Message from the AIA President</a>.&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll benefit the most if you take the time to read each section BEFORE submitting an application.</p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">We want to make sure you know that AIA is a faith-based ministry. This means that we don&rsquo;t have central funds to pay employee salaries. All of our staff members raise the money needed to pay their salary, benefits and ministry expenses. You can go&nbsp;<a href="/careers/compensation" style="color: #990000; text-decoration: none;">here</a>&nbsp;for more information on how this works.</p></div></div>
