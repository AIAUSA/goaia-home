The opportunities that basketball is creating around the world are endless.  As a ministry we are in the process of preparing to host more athletes, teams and events at our world headquarters as we are soon to break ground on the $18M Wooden Family Fieldhouse.  

We need people who value the game of basketball and want to see its people grow for the glory of God.  

We dream of a day when there is a Christ-follower on every team, in every nation.  

Here are some immediate needs we have as a team: 

**AIA Basketball Tour and Project Directors/Recruiters**

Use your knowledge of basketball to impact the world by engaging collegiate athletes and coaches in international outreach tours. Your responsibilities would include setting up and directing an overseas tour each year. This includes working with U.S. and overseas staff to plan outreaches and competition schedules. Other duties include making travel arrangements, coaching participants through the support-raising process, and other administrative duties. You’ll also spend time building relationships with team members as they prepare for a tour. Additionally, you’ll be involved in the ongoing recruitment of athletes and staff for Sports T.E.A.M tours. This means attending college games throughout the season and attending conference tournaments, as well as NAIA, NCCAA, and NCAA DI, II, and III tournaments.

**The Wooden Family Fieldhouse Basketball Coordinator**

Accelerate Athletes in Action’s overall mission of building spiritual movements everywhere through leveraging our facilities and position in the sports world for Christ. The primary role of the WFF Basketball Coordinator is to assist their Sports Department in accomplishing the spiritual, relational and financial goals established for them in the Wooden Fieldhouse operational Pro-Forma.
Here is a link for the design plans of the [Wooden Family Fieldhouse](http://www.woodenfamilyfieldhouse.com/).


**AIA Basketball Internship (12-15 months)**

During your AIA basketball internship you will have opportunities for personal, professional, and spiritual growth.  This will be accomplished through hands-on ministry experience in college & international basketball, growing together in quality Christian community, and intentional discipleship and mentoring from our AIA Basketball staff.  Unique opportunities include: competing on an international basketball tour, the International Basketball Coaches Academy,  Residential Academy, Final Four ministry, HBCU Coaches Retreat, Captains Academies, and more.

Do any of these positions fit with the dreams that God has already begun working in your heart?  Let’s start the conversation to imagine what it could look like to serve as a basketball missionary with Athletes in Action Basketball.

If you are interested in being a basketball missionary and one of these roles doesn’t seem to be an exact fit, please contact us anyway, as finding the right people is our greatest need.
