<p>&ldquo;It was a very busy and interesting two weeks. I was interacting with coaches from six different countries. During a very short time we became a group of friends. With our group we visited secondary, high school, collegiate and university practices, and attended all levels of basketball games, including an NBA game in Indianapolis (Indiana Pacers vs. Orlando Magic). It was amazing. We had a great chance to talk with many coaches and see many different styles of coaching. We met with successful people and attended their lectures. Daily &lsquo;team time&rsquo; helped us to know more about leadership and growth as a person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;[The camp] was mind-blowing&hellip;visiting the country&rsquo;s (USA) top collegiate and high school basketball programs &ndash; both the facilities and the programs &ndash; [and seeing] how practices are excellently run. Also, I got to personally meet and listen to two great coaches whose programs I have used and admired.&rdquo;</p>
