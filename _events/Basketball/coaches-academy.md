    quote: "“It was a very busy and interesting two weeks. I was interacting with
      coaches from six different countries. During a very short time we became a group
      of friends. With our group we visited secondary, high school, collegiate and
      university practices, and attended all levels of basketball games, including
      an NBA game in Indianapolis (Indiana Pacers vs. Orlando Magic). It was amazing.
      We had a great chance to talk with many coaches and see many different styles
      of coaching. We met with successful people and attended their lectures. Daily
      ‘team time’ helped us to know more about leadership and growth as a person.”"
