Travel the world while competing and serving others. Part sports camp and part mission trip, AIA Soccer gives you the chance to blend your sport and faith while experiencing another culture, all for the purpose of sharing the gospel around the world. 

While every trip offers unique experiences and opportunities, all of our tours have the same basic components: several games against local teams, soccer camps and clinics to help national athletes and coaches hone their skills, as well as humanitarian aid projects and a variety of outreach opportunities. In all of these activities, youâ€™ll be serving to accelerate the growth of the local AIA and sports ministries.
