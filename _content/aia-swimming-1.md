      Since 1979 Athletes In Action Swimming has sought to impact the world of competitive aquatic sports through developing athletes’ God-given potential, building biblical character into lives, touching hearts cross-culturally, and sharing with others the life-changing message of love, hope and forgiveness found in Jesus Christ.

      Summer mission projects, international sports/mission tours, swimmers’ chapels, age-group summer swim camps, elite training camps, evangelistic swim clinics and personal discipleship are some of the ways AIA Swimming has impacted the world of competitive swimming over the last 40+ years.

      Athletes In Action Swimming began in 1979 when several world-class swimmers from the University of Southern California asked AIA to begin a Christian swim team. AIA Swimming has impacted the sport for over 40 years through…

      * Summer missions projects in California and Colorado for collegiate swimmers from around the United States.
      * Evangelistic swim clinics where world-class and Olympic swimmers demonstrated swimming technique and shared their faith in Christ.
      * International tours to Europe to share Jesus Christ with swimmers, coaches and host families.
      * Sponsoring dozens of evangelistic age-group swim camps in Colorado, Georgia, Indiana, Illinois and Alabama.
      * Discipling hundreds of collegiate swimmers and training them how to apply biblical principles to sports and faith.
      * Hosting Swimmers’ Chapels at local, regional and national swim meets.

    quote: |-
      My time with Athletes In Action, especially the Ultimate Training Camp and the AIA Special, catapulted me spiritually to a whole new level. The friendships and discipleship I received created a foundation of a better attitude, stronger work ethic, humility, and insight into relationships that had immediate impact on my life and future.

      AIA helped me become a better husband and father, and helped me win gold and silver medals in the Olympic Games. No matter where I was, I was equipped to share my faith winsomely and lovingly. I can’t imagine my life without Athletes In Action.

      University of Kansas
    quote: |-
      I first got involved with the AIA Swim Camps via my college coach. God worked through those camps and the sport of swimming, learning about a personal relationship with Christ, applying biblical principles to athletics, living out the gospel each day with my team, and glorifying God through sport.


      After graduation, I joined AIA Staff at the University of Virginia. After two years on AIA staff, I decided to go back into full-time coaching at my alma-mater. AIA has had a long-lasting impact on my life and I’m forever grateful that God has used the ministry of AIA Swimming to grow and mature me in my relationship with Christ and others.

    quote: "For me, Athletes in Action Swimming has been all about community. We are\nthe
      Body of Christ in…the world of competitive swimming. \n\n\nAn Athletes in Action
      chapel is like a family gathering. We get to look at competition differently;\nwe
      know there is a larger purpose at work in our lives; and we get to affirm\nthat
      in one another. To know and be known by other followers of Jesus, regardless\nof
      our accomplishments or failures, sets our thinking right."

    quote: |-
      The adage, “God doesn’t call the equipped; He equips the called,” describes me perfectly. I prayed that God would use me to make an impact for Him at the AIA Swim Camps and that the overflow of my relationship with Christ would spill over into my relationship with the campers.

      We don’t always know how we have affected someone for Christ this side of eternity, but I hope I was able to inspire a few to become sold-out Jesus followers and to be light in their circles of influence.
