      Each Pro Soccer Chaplaincy Mission trip is as unique and exciting as the country we visit, and each player and coach is a changed person when they arrive back home. As we arrive in Africa, the Caribbean or Latin America, it’s our desire to use the beautiful game of soccer to build lasting relationships with our new friends.

      These relationships may be with the soccer federation, local professional coaches and their teams or the grass roots of the youth teams. We bring and leave our soccer knowledge, experience, passion and equipment for others to use in their development.

      We also seek to explore the local country and its towns and people so that we can get to know their cultures, customs and food.

      Many times we collect new or used equipment from the players, their teams, the leagues or local organizations and take it with us for distribution. We also seek to help with some humanitarian aid such as providing food, hygiene products or other needs.
