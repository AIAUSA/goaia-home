      Each Pro Soccer Chaplaincy Mission trip is as unique and exciting as the country we visit, and each player and coach is a changed person when they arrive back home. As we arrive in Africa, the Caribbean or Latin America, itâ€™s our desire to use the beautiful game of soccer to build lasting relationships with our new friends.

      These relationships may be with the soccer federation, local professional coaches and their teams or the grass roots of the youth teams. We bring and leave our soccer knowledge, experience, passion and equipment for others to use in their development.
