      Since 1979 Athletes In Action Swimming has sought to impact the world of competitive aquatic sports through developing athletes’ God-given potential, building biblical character into lives, touching hearts cross-culturally, and sharing with others the life-changing message of love, hope and forgiveness found in Jesus Christ.

      Summer mission projects, international sports/mission tours, swimmers’ chapels, age-group summer swim camps, elite training camps, evangelistic swim clinics and personal discipleship comprise some of the events and projects AIA Swimming has sponsored over the last 40+ years.

      Athletes In Action Swimming began in 1979 when several world-class swimmers from the University of Southern California asked AIA to begin a Christian swim team. Swimming history has been made over 40+ years through…

      * Summer missions projects in Southern California and Colorado for collegiate swimmers from around the United States.
      * Evangelistic swim clinics where world-class and Olympic swimmers demonstrated swimming technique and shared their faith in Christ.
      * International tours to Europe to share Jesus Christ with swimmers, coaches and host families.
      * Sponsoring dozens of evangelistic age-group swim camps in Colorado, Georgia, Indiana, Illinois and Alabama.
      * Discipling hundreds of collegiate swimmers and training them how to apply biblical principles to sports and faith.
      * Hosting Swimmers’ Chapels at local, regional and national swim meets.
