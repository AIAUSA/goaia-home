      Since 1979 Athletes In Action Swimming has sought to impact the world of competitive aquatic sports through developing athletes’ God-given potential, building biblical character into lives, touching hearts cross-culturally, and sharing with others the life-changing message of love, hope and forgiveness found in Jesus Christ.

      Summer mission projects, international sports/mission tours, swimmers’ chapels, age-group summer swim camps, elite training camps, evangelistic swim clinics and personal discipleship comprise some of the events and projects AIA Swimming has sponsored over the last 40+ years.
