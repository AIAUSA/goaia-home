                <p>AIA Wrestling has been equiping young men to be leaders for over 45 years. &nbsp;Not only leaders in
                    the sport of wrestling, but in their families, churches, schools, work places and communities. Real
                    leadership is born from real world experiences guided by men of integrity and character, who
                    understand the link between our lives, our sport and our faith. &nbsp; These real experiences are
                    the molds used to prepare young men for a lifetime of making a difference regardless of the path
                    life takes them. &nbsp;</p>

                    "AIA has taught me how to compete with the mindset of putting God first, freeing me to compete at a
                    higher potential without the added stress that I had before. It has helped me with keeping my anger
                    in check if I lose a match. AIA has encouraged me to dive into the Bible and get involved in
                    community. I see how important both is for growth in your faith. In life, the things I've learned
                    from AIA help me to get through tough situations with minimal stress and remind me that God can be
                    given glory in everything I do. AIA has provided a great community and challenged me to reach out to
                    others. It also has presented me with opportunities to grow, like the Mongolia trip, which otherwise
                    I wouldn't have had. Most importantly it showed me my need for Christ in my everyday life and the
                    saving power of His death and resurrection. Before my AIA trip I was a devoted Christian and
                    wrestler but saw the two as separate. My trip to Mongolia in 2015 left me with numerous lifelong
                    memories, unforgettable experiences, and a network of other great Christian wrestlers. More
                    importantly I was able to see how my relationship with God and wrestling went hand in hand and that
                    by strengthening one I was also strengthening the other."</p>
