                    <p >AIA Wrestling has been equiping young men to be leaders for over 45 years. &nbsp;Not only leaders in the sport of wrestling, but in their families, churches, schools, work places and communities. Real leadership is born from real world experiences guided by men of integrity and character, who understand the link between our lives, our sport and our faith. &nbsp; These real experiences are the molds used to prepare young men for a lifetime of making a difference regardless of the path life takes them. &nbsp;</p>

                    <p ><img width="176" height="235" alt="" src="/uploads/Wrestling/Ethan-Ramos.JPG" style="float: right;"> "AIA has taught me how to compete with the mindset of putting God first, freeing me to compete at a higher potential without the added stress that I had before. It has helped me with keeping my anger in check if I lose a match. AIA has encouraged me to dive into the Bible and get involved in community. I see how important both is for growth in your faith. In life, the things I've learned from AIA help me to get through tough situations with minimal stress and remind me that God can be given glory in everything I do. AIA has provided a great community and challenged me to reach out to others. It also has presented me with opportunities to grow, like the Mongolia trip, which otherwise I wouldn't have had. Most importantly it showed me my need for Christ in my everyday life and the saving power of His death and resurrection. Before my AIA trip I was a devoted Christian and wrestler but saw the two as separate. My trip to Mongolia in 2015 left me with numerous lifelong memories, unforgettable experiences, and a network of other great Christian wrestlers. More importantly I was able to see how my relationship with God and wrestling went hand in hand and that by strengthening one I was also strengthening the other."</p>
