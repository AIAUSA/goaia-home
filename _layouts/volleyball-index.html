It has shaped my thoughts going forward with my life and career. I am forever grateful for this opportunity."</p>

                                <p>“During the first week of training camp I was looking forward to playing a lot of volleyball with talented athletes. What I didn’t realize was that I would eventually turn my focus from playing volleyball to learning how to share my faith with others. I didn’t know how to share my faith before my AIA trip, but I was taught how to organize and present my testimony. I was excited about this because it gave me the confidence to talk to anyone about my faith. <br>I loved the fact that we trained in our sport, but more importantly in our faith. Making athletics part of my spiritual life was a concept that really altered my faith. I learned that I could use my love of playing volleyball to show others my love for God and everything He has done for me. It was truly an amazing experience – being able to pray with someone who I’d never met before and to grow in my relationship with God.”</p>

God is so much bigger than our fears, weaknesses and less-than-ideal situations. There are lives at stake, and eternity is not a game. We need to GO and MAKE disciples with the same sense of urgency that we have in earning points in a match.”</p>
