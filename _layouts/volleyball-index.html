                                    Jesus....AIA has inspired me to bring the knowledge and ideals we implemented on
                                    our tour team to my team on campus. I'm going to try to teach my teammates how to
                                    play for Christ, and how to inspire others around us to do the same. ”</p>

                                <p>“AIA is a ministry that has impacted my life in so many ways. I attended AIA
                                    meetings in college, but was never very serious about them. It wasn't until right
                                    after my collegiate career, and the beginning of my pro career, that I became
                                    passionate about learning what it looked like to invite God onto the volleyball
                                    court with me, and to glorify Him through my sport. On tour, God was a work on my
                                    heart, and I was able to learn so much from the amazing staff, our coaches, and my
                                    teammates. To be able to come alongside other Christian volleyball players,
                                    surrender control, and just play in freedom for God and God alone, was one of the
                                    best experiences of my life. Now I get to continue living out those principles
                                    alongside other pro volleyball Christians through a Bible study that the staff at
                                    AIA have been so amazing to organize. Being so far from home is extremely hard,
                                    especially not being surrounded by community. Having this small group is a
                                    highlight of my week, and a way to be encouraged and feel connected to other
                                    like-minded people playing volleyball abroad. "</p>

                                <p>“During the first week of training camp I was looking forward to playing a lot of
                                    volleyball with talented athletes. What I didn’t realize was that I would
                                    eventually turn my focus from playing volleyball to learning how to share my faith
                                    with others. I didn’t know how to share my faith before my AIA trip, but I was
                                    taught how to organize and present my testimony. I was excited about this because
                                    it gave me the confidence to talk to anyone about my faith. <br>I loved the fact
                                    that we trained in our sport, but more importantly in our faith. Making athletics
                                    part of my spiritual life was a concept that really altered my faith. I learned
                                    that I could use my love of playing volleyball to show others my love for God and
                                    everything He has done for me. It was truly an amazing experience – being able to
                                    pray with someone who I’d never met before and to grow in my relationship with
                                    God.”</p>

                                        been on staff with Athletes in Action since 2015. Originally from Houston, she
                                        played middle for Texas State University. Amber was involved in FCA and after
                                        catching the vision for how sports and ministry can be combined to make a huge
                                        impact for Jesus, she decided to join AIA in the mission of using the language
                                        of the sport to reach every with the Gospel.</p>

                                        has led missional teams to Thailand, Central Asia and Brazil. If you asked her
                                        where within this department that she is most passionate about, she would tell
                                        you, without a doubt, beach volleyball! She has a heart to dive into the beach
                                        world and to provide opportunities for beach players to grow and make an
                                        impact.</p>
