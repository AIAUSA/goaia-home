This team will be comprised of Div I/II or equivalent level women's players looking to grow spiritually as they play the game and share their faith in Christ. The duration of the time will be spent in the city of Nairobi after a training camp in Xenia, OH. This is a life changing experience where you can grow in your faith, learn to share it with others, conduct basketball camps and clinics, gain international playing experience, train along top-level university teams, and build deep friendships as you experience a new culture and extend humanitarian aid throughout.
