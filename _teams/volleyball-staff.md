We have a range of positions open that we are looking to fill! As we expand into Beach and add an indoor gym to our complex here at the AIA National Office, we are also looking to expand our staff team! Through working with AIA, you will be a part of a worldwide movement using the platform of sport, in our case volleyball, to share the Good News of Jesus with the world. You will have the opportunity to win people to Christ, build them up in their faith and send them out to do the same! Because AIA is a faith-based organization, potential staff members must meet unique qualifications. Learn more here. For more information and to apply, go here.
