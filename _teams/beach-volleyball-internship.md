During this internship you will focus specifically on AIA Volleyball events and ministry pertaining to Beach Volleyball. You will be helping to plan and put on clinics and tours domestically and internationally, in which you will be taking part in direct ministry locally and beyond through investing your time in coaching, training, and playing at an open level.

Just like all of our internships, we will help you refine or develop skills that will equip you to be a lifelong laborer and leader for Christ and to pour into other volleyball players and coaches. Every intern will do much of their ministry training in our weekly AIA Institute designed to develop and care for our new staff and interns.

This internship if available for men and women.
