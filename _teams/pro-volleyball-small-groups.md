This is our second year facilitating small groups for Pro Volleyballers. The purpose of these groups is to mobilize, equip and encourage players in the mission field that God has given them on their international pro teams. We meet weekly for 10 weeks in the fall and 10 weeks in the spring. We will accept players into groups anytime throughout the year. We, also, accept athletes from other sports.
