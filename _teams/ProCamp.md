Our mission for this camp is to help you to use the platform of professional athletics to be a family on mission to expand the Kingdom of God. This camp will be focused on equipping you with the ministry skills and community that you need to flourish in your player missionary position wherever God has placed you! Our time will include hearing from seasoned missionaries and former professional volleyball players who used their platform as an opportunity to do missions!
