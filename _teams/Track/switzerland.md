### Cancelled due to COVID-19
AIA Togo has a growing influence within the sports culture in this French speaking African country. The focus of this team will be training with their athletes, connecting with the Athletic Federation, teaching and learning from coaches and sports medicine specialists. This team will be looking for sprinters, hurdlers, long/triple jumpers, and throwers. In addition, we would like a few coaches, and sports medicine professionals (MDs, DOs, PTs, ATCs, massage therapists).
