### Cancelled due to COVID-19
St. Moritz (altitude 6000’) hosted the 1928 and 1948 Winter Olympics and currently is a training destination for many of the world’s elite athletes.  Over the past 6 summers, AIA Switzerland has served these men and women by providing physiotherapy and massage therapy services. This team’s focus will be building relationships through training and social events. Athletes from the 800m and up are welcome to apply. There are performance standards to qualify for consideration for this team.
