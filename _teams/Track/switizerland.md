St. Moritz (altitude 6000’) hosted the 1928 and 1948 Winter Olympics and currently is a training destination for many of the world’s elite athletes.  Over the past 5-6 summers AIA Switzerland has served these men and women by providing physiotherapy and massage therapy services. This team’s focus will be building relationships through training and social events. Due to the population of athletes at the training center, this project is for distance runners and will have some performance standards.
