You can expect around a total of 5 games that will give you an international basketball experience. The group will spend time in Swaziland for ministry outreach as well as Johannesburg. There will also be a day for sightseeing in Sun City, South Africa, which will be a fun opportunity to experience the beauty of the country. Like all the AIA trips you have the chance to grow personally, in your walk with Jesus, and make friends that will last a lifetime. Information Coming Soon!
