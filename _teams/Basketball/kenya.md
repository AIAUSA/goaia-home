We will be traveling to Kenya to play games against University and Pro teams. Players will have the life-changing experience of working with kids in the largest slum in all of Africa, called Kibera located in the heart of Nairobi. Everyone on the tour will get the chance to go on a Safari! Most importantly we pray that everyone involved will experience personal growth, grow in your walk with the Lord, get international basketball experience, make friends for life.
