The 2020 FISU Pan-American Games are a Division I opportunity to represent the USA in high-level competition against other countries from North, Central, and South America. Each team will compete for a gold, silver, or bronze medal, and the USA Team will engage in local service projects in MÃ©rida, Mexico, prior to the start of the tournament. This is a chance for athletes to experience total growth: body, mind, and soul, while also gaining invaluable memories over their summer.
