TUFF Camp began in 1990 to create an environment where young athletes learn how to train physically, mentally, and spiritually. As collegiate staff you will mentor high school runners and share with them how you have matured athletically, as well as spiritually. The staff teams will meet a couple days prior to the start dates of each camp. This is the 1st year in Colorado and the 30th year in Michigan.
