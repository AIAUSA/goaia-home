During this internship you will focus specifically on leading international and domestic AIA Volleyball competing tours. You will be helping to plan all that a tour entails: recruiting the team, communicating with our international staff of the location we are traveling to, discipleship and leading before and during the tour. This a great internship to help you to grow in leadership and to learn the ins and outs of short term missions through sports.

Just like all of our internships, we will help you refine or develop skills that will equip you to be a lifelong laborer and leader for Christ and to pour into other volleyball players and coaches. Every intern will do much of their ministry training in our weekly AIA Institute designed to develop and care for our new staff and interns.

This internship is available for men and women.
