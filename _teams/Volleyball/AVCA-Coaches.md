We will be at Booth #942 (right next to the FCA booth) during the AVCA Marketplace. We would love to connect with you at the Marketplace, during our events below and anytime during the week!

**AIA/FCA Events:**

Wednesday December 12th, 7:30 pm - AIA/FCA Coaches Connection Night

Friday December 14th, 7:30 am - FCA Coaches Breakfast

Our heart is to journey with you as you focus on developing your staff and athletes as leaders of influence, on and off the court. The opportunities we offer through Athletes in Action Volleyball are, also, designed to partner with you, as the coach, in teaching your staff and players to leave a powerful legacy. We look forward to connecting with you there!
