The Pro Volleyball Bible Study is to mobilize, equip and encourage players in the mission field that God has given them on their international pro teams. The groups meet weekly for 10 weeks in the fall and 10 weeks in the spring. We will accept players into groups anytime throughout the year. There are also groups available for other sports.
