This will be our first ever Pro Retreat! This is a continuation of the small groups we facilitate throughout the year for Pro Athletes, but being in the small group is not a requirement in order to come to the retreat. During the retreat we will have tons of fellowship designed to refresh you while you are on leave and we will equip you further to find purpose in and beyond your sport, what we call "Victory Beyond Competition." You will learn to grow in Christ and multiply your life into others stateside and abroad on your team and in your host city. You must be playing currently playing pro or seeking a contract in order to join us for the retreat.
