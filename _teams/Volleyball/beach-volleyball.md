This will be our first ever Beach Volleyball Tour! 

You will receive high level training with other top university beach players. But the training won’t end when you leave the court. We will, also, equip you to find purpose in and beyond your sport, what we call “Victory Beyond Competition.” You will learn to grow in Christ and multiply your life into others.

On top of training, we will compete in local collegiate and open beach tournaments and put to practice the ministry skills we are learning.

You will leave more equipped to grow and minister through the sport of volleyball and you will be connected to a community of beach volleyball players from all over the country.
