Like all of our tours, we will start off with a training camp where you will receive high level training with other top university beach players. But the training won't end when you leave the court. We will also equip you to find purpose in and beyond your sport, what we call "Victory Beyond Competition." You will learn to grow in Christ and multiply your life into others. We will then travel together to Mauritius, where we will compete against local teams and put to practice the ministry skills we learned in training camp. You will leave tour more equipped to grow and minister through the sport of volleyball and you will be connected to a community of beach volleyball players from all over the country.
