Athletes in Action Volleyball was started in 1982 by Barb Bernlohr and Bobby Herron. The first women's team was sent out that same year, traveling to Japan. Our focus has been to send our teams internationally, which has led us all over the globe to countries&nbsp;in Latin America, Africa, Europe and Asia. We understand the hunger athletes have to learn and to go out and see&nbsp;the world. From this hunger, tours and projects were born to challenge and provide space for those athletes to learn, grow and go. AIA Volleyball is committed to seeking God's leading, looking to maximize the impact in the countries we travel to, and investing wholly into the participants on our tours.

## Looking for a challenge?

AIA Volleyball is always looking for players and coaches who want to take the challenge of going beyond the court, while still using their skills and passion for volleyball to make a difference in the world.&nbsp;<span>Sport is one of the few languages that can cross cultural and spoken language barriers.&nbsp;<span>Sport gives us the opportunity to use volleyball all over the world to open doors, build bridges and change lives. </span>It's impact goes well beyond the scoreboard
